# To-Do List App

This is a to-do list app designed for easy task management. It allows users to add items to their to-do list and mark them as completed by selecting a checkbox. This app does not rely on a database to store tasks, so tasks are not saved between sessions.

## Installation

This app is built using JavaScript and EJS in a Node.js environment. The following npm packages are required: express, ejs and body-parser.

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed to run the app.

To confirm that node has been installed, enter the following command in the terminal.

```bash
node -v
```
You should see the version of node you have just installed.

## Usage 

- Clone or download the code repository.

- Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install 
```
- Start the Node.js server:

```bash
node index.js
```
- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000 to access the to-do list app.

- Use the input field to add tasks to your to-do list.

- Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough).

- Tasks are not saved between sessions; they are for temporary use during the current session.
